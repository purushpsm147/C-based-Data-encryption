# C-based-Data-encryption
We will try to get an input say university/job id (14BEC1043) and try to encrypt your private data and details related to to your id in a circular queue . I am trying to implement this here using the concept of public and private key, which i will generate using the matrix inversion technique. Also I will try to encode the data in ASCII in a Arithmetic or Geometric Progression to make it more complicated and avoid frequency analysis. This will be my first upload on github so please be gentle !! 
This is a C code so you will probably need a C compiler. I will reccomend using DEV C++ IDE. It comes with an open source C compiler.
This C code was one of my first code in the University project.
I had written it in my second year of college with my friend Rohit.Pretty tough time.
